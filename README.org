* django-auth0-auth

Authentication backend for Django with Auth0.

This project is not affiliated with Auth0.

** Usage

Take a look at the sample app provided in =sample/= to see how it's used in a MWE.
There are only a few steps.
First, include the app in your apps:

#+begin_src 
#+end_src

Next, include the auth backend

#+begin_src 
#+end_src

Finally, include the urls

#+begin_src  
#+end_src

** Next steps

+ [ ] Test that it works with the sample app (create an auth0 account to test)
+ [ ] Run through genAI to look for general improvements (is all the logic we have in the views/index the right place for this?)
+ [ ] Add pre-commit code checks
+ [ ] Add automated release via github action
+ [ ] Flesh out user documentation here in README
+ [ ] Add automated tests
+ [ ] Profit
